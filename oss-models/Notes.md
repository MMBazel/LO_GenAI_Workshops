# Resources for Mini-Workshop: Crash Course Open Source Models

In the mini-workshop we covered a couple different tutorials, tools and resources as an introduction to working with open-source LLMs. 

ðŸ‘‡ The links to the referenced resources are below ðŸ‘‡

## Slides & Talk
* Slides should be in this repo but backup slides will also be posted to LinkedIn
* For the talk video, check with Tine &/or Rex. 

## Notebooks & Tutorial Materials 

### Using TinyLlama Chat
* Chatting with TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 on Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0

### Fine-Tuning: Creating a Taylor Swift fine-tuned model 
There are two notebooks (exact same project): 
* [Mini]_HelloTaylorSwift_FineTuning.ipynb - This is the minimal amount of code need to fine-tune a tinyllama model on Taylor Swift lyrics.
* [Explainer]_HelloTaylorSwift_FineTuning.ipynb - This is the explainer notebook; it has a lot more unnecessary code (like print statements), is peppered with explanations about each code block. At the end I also offer some suggestions for how to extend the notebook.

There are some requirements that need to be met to work, namely that you need:
1. Need a Huggingface account
2. Need a Google Colab account.

In both cases, having a Pro subscription is super helpful (and well-worth it) especially if your lcoal computer isn't powerful enough to fine-tune (although I picked TinyLlama specifically because of the size). 

With that being said, it shouldn't be required.

### RAG 
There are two notebooks/spaces that I showed and which offer a great introduction to using RAG. 

* Chat with your code using RAG! (Easy Mode) - https://lightning.ai/lightning-ai/studios/chat-with-your-code-using-rag?section=featured

* Chat with your code: Using Weaviate, LlamaIndex, & Ollama (Not so easy) - https://lightning.ai/weaviate/studios/chat-with-your-code-rag-with-weaviate-and-llamaindex

Right now Lightning.ai has a really generous pricing & billing structure + if you sign up with your real-number you'll get an additional 15 compute units. I ran the Weaviate notebook at least 20 times on the A100 and only burned down 3 units, so there's plenty for building example projects.
