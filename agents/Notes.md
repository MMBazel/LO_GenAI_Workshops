## Introduction to Agents
### Ingredients of agents

> Here are the main ingredients for building an agent (mini üßµ)
> Query Planning: Given the task + surrounding context, decompose it into a series of steps (chain-of-thought, DAG, tree). Can be represented as a simple prompt call with structured outputs.
> Memory: Store state across user tasks, to better inform the next task. Important for any chatbot!
> Tool Use: Use the LLM to make API calls to any external system. This could be a vector db (through auto-retrieval). This could also be calling an external API (Slack, Gmail, Calendar) 

### The knitty-gritty of building & using agents
* Emerging AI Agent Architectures - presents a concise summary of emerging AI agent architectures; it focuses the discussion on capabilities like reasoning, planning, and tool calling which are all needed to build complex AI-powered agentic workflows and systems; the report includes current capabilities, limitations, insights, and ideas for future development of AI agent design.

Andre Ng on
> Last week, I described four design patterns for AI agentic workflows that I believe will drive significant progress: Reflection, Tool use, Planning and Multi-agent collaboration. Instead of having an LLM generate its final output directly, an agentic workflow prompts the LLM multiple times, giving it opportunities to build step by step to higher-quality output.
