In addition, low-rank adaptation is only done for the query and values weights in the attention heads of the transformers, while all other areas of the model are frozen.

To be certain, we'll be tall again Whether weather be the frost Or the violence of the dog days I'm on waves, out being tossed Is there a line that I could just go cross? And when I was shipwrecked Can't think of all the cost I thought of you All the things that will be lost now In the cracks of light Can we just get a pause? I dreamed of you To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs It was real enough Whether weather be the frost To get me through Or the violence of the dog days Or the violence of the dog days Out on waves, being tossed I'm on waves, out being tossed I swear Is there a line that we can just go cross? You were there And I was catching my breath Floors of a cabin creaking under my step And I couldn't be sure I had a feeling so peculiar This pain wouldn't be for Evermore Evermore Evermore This pain wouldn't be for evermore Evermore Friends break up, friends get married Strangers get born, strangers get buried Trends change, rumors fly through new skies But I'm right where you left me Matches burn after the other Pages turn and stick to each other Wages earned and lessons learned But I, I'm right where you left me Help, I'm still at the restaurant Still sitting in a corner I haunt Cross legged in the dim light They say, What a sad sight I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop Right when I felt the moment stop Glass shattered on the white cloth Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there Dust collected on my pinned up hair They expected me to find somewhere Some perspective, but I sat and stared Right where you left me You left me no, you left me no You left me no choice but to stay here forever You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no You left me no choice but to stay here forever  Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen? Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it She's still twenty three inside her fantasy How it was supposed to be Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion? Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it She's still twenty three inside her fantasy And you're sitting in front of me At the restaurant when I was still the one you want Cross legged in the dim light, everything was just right I, I could feel the mascara run You told me that you met someone Glass shattered on the white cloth Everybody moved on Help, I'm still at the restaurant Still sitting in a corner I haunt Cross legged in the dim light They say, What a sad sight I, I stayed there Dust collected on my pinned up hair I'm sure that you got a wife out there Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware 'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm Mind my business If our love died young I can't bear witness And it's been so long But if you ever think you got it wrong I'm right where You left me You left me no, oh, you left me no You left me no choice but to stay here forever You left me You left me no, oh, you left me no\n",

right by I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides The knife cuts both ways If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break And I fell from the pedestal Right down the rabbit hole Long story
